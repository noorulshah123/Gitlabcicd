I wanted to confirm the current status from my side, especially since this is visible to the client as well.
I wanted to share the current status and some context.


Cybersecurity Foundation Training
I had completed the Cybersecurity Foundation training on <DD-MMM-YYYY> (around six months ago). I am attaching the completion certificate/screenshot for your reference.
If it is still reflecting as pending in the system, please let me know if I should raise a ticket with the LMS / compliance team to get it updated.

Privileged Account Access Self-Certification
The other item mentioned in the email is the self-certification/attestation required to continue having access to our privileged account.
This access is needed for authentication and to use Terraform Cloud workspaces for performing operations on AWS SageMaker and Bedrock platform services, as part of the Advanced <XYZ> team.
I have completed this self-certification today, and I am attaching the confirmation screenshot as evidence.
